Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Camilo
A passionate Software Developer and Materials Engineer from Colombia

Since I was a child I am passionate about technology, I have always liked to format computers, cell phones, get into the software of my video game consoles, realizing in the end that what I really love in life is technology, so I do what I like my way of living.
